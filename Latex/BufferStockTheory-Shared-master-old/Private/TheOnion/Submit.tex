Mr Zwiebel,

Although the attached paper is perhaps a bit on the light-hearted and trivial side for a publication as
weighty as ``The Onion,'' I thought that a few of its more sensationalist claims might catch your attention
and you might encourage me to dig more deeply into the topics treated humorously herein.

Am looking forward to hearing back from you with your accustomed rapid turnaround of less than two years
for a first response.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\ps{PS. The paper as submitted is certainly too short for publication in an outlet like ``The Onion'' which is known for
  the depth and long-windedness of its articles.  It will be easy to pad it out with further theorems and other results
as you may request.}
